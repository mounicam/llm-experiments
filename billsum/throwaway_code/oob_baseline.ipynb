Firstly, the existing transfer mechanism for motorboat fuel taxes is being redesigned, with a shift in how these funds are allocated.  Section 9504(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to clarify the allocation process, ensuring that a specific amount ($77,500,000 in 1995, $80,000,000 in subsequent years, and $90,000,000 in 1998) is distributed annually to the Boat Safety Account, with the Secretary of the Interior designating the amount available for expenditure.  This allocation is designed to support recreational boating safety programs across the country, with specific guidelines for how these funds are used.  Further amendments to the Act of August 9, 1950, including revisions to the funding authorization for these programs, are also implemented, ensuring continued support for these vital initiatives.

Section 2 addresses technical amendments to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, clarifying the role of the Boat Safety Account and providing specific details regarding the allocation of funds for recreational boating safety programs.  Specifically, the legislation streamlines the distribution of funds, directing $77,500,000 to the Boat Safety Account for 1995, $80,000,000 for 1996 and 1997, and $90,000,000 for 1998, to be used by the Secretary of Transportation for programs and projects.  Furthermore, Section 4 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to provide detailed guidelines regarding the spending of funds allocated to the Boat Safety Account, including provisions for final vouchers, and clarifies the availability of funds for programs.  The final amendment to Section 13106 of title 46, United States Code, which governs recreational boating safety, is also revised to clarify the total spending authority for these programs.  The overall aim of these changes is to ensure a more transparent and efficient system for managing these funds and supporting recreational boating activities.\", 'C2': 'Here’s a summary of the text for a C2 reader, presented as a paragraph:\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Code has undergone significant revisions concerning the transportation of motorboat fuel taxes from highway trust funds. Section 1, pertaining to transfers of these funds, mandates a specific formula for distributing funds annually, contingent on the motorboat fuel tax received on or after October 1, 1993, and before 1997.  This formula, detailed in Section 9503(c)(4), necessitates a transfer of $1,000,000 per year to the land and water conservation fund, with the Secretary of the Interior distributing funds based on the amount determined by the Highway Trust Fund.  Furthermore, Section 9504(d) alters the technical amendment related to aquatic resources, clarifying the allocation of funds for the Boat Safety Account and establishing a new process for managing balances.  Section 2 addresses specific funding mechanisms for recreational boating safety programs, including a provision for the Secretary of the Interior to allocate funds for State programs, with a stipulation that these funds remain available until expended.  The amendments to Section 4 and 5, focusing on the authorization of expenditures for these programs and the subsequent allocation of funds, effectively streamline the process and enhance accountability for the distribution of these funds, aligning with the requirements of Title 46 of the United States Code.  The overall aim of these revisions is to ensure the efficient and transparent management of these transportation funds, supporting recreational boating safety initiatives.'}}\n"
