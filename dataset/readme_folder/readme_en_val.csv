These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor."," The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed.

Some bacteria  produce toxins, which cause diseases. These are endotoxins, which come from broken bacterial cells, and exotoxins,  which are produced by bacteria and released into the environment. The bacterium Clostridium botulinum for example, produces a powerful exotoxin that cause respiratory paralysis, and Salmonellae produce an endotoxin that causes gastroenteritis. Some exotoxins can be converted to toxoids, which are used as vaccines to prevent the disease.Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics, and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection."," Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.",Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all.,4Wikipedia,Natural Sciences,"In some specific fields of science, the results of observation differ depending on factors that are not important in everyday observation.

Eugene O’Curry wants to establish that compositions of an older date than the twelfth century existed in Ireland in the twelfth century, and thus he proceeds.  He takes one of the great extant Irish manuscripts, the _Leabhar na h’Uidhre_; or, _Book of the Dun Cow_.  The compiler of this book was, he says, a certain Maelmuiri, a member of the religious house of Cluainmacnois.  This he establishes from a passage in the manuscript itself: ‘This is a trial of his pen here, by Maelmuiri, son of the son of Conn na m’Bocht.’  The date of Maelmuiri he establishes from a passage in the _Annals of the Four Masters_, under the year 1106: ‘Maelmuiri, son of the son of Conn na m’Bocht, was killed in the middle of the great stone church of Cluainmacnois, by a party of robbers.’  Thus he gets the date of the _Book of the Dun Cow_.  This book contains an elegy on the death of St. Columb.  Now, even before 1106, the language of this elegy was so old as to require a gloss to make it intelligible, for it is accompanied by a gloss written between the lines.  This gloss quotes, for the explanation of obsolete words, a number of more ancient compositions; and these compositions, therefore, must, at the beginning of the twelfth century, have been still in existence.  Nothing can be sounder; every step is proved, and fairly proved, as one goes along.  O’Curry thus affords a good specimen of the sane mode of proceeding so much wanted in Celtic researches, and so little practised by Edward Davies and his brethren; and to found this sane method, Zeuss, by the example he sets in his own department of philology, has mainly contributed.","His influence has already been most happy; and as I have enlarged on a certain failure in criticism of Eugene O’Curry’s,—whose business, after all, was the description and classification of materials rather than criticism,—let me show, by another example from Eugene O’Curry, this good influence of Zeuss upon Celtic studies.","Eugene O’Curry wants to establish that compositions of an older date than the twelfth century existed in Ireland in the twelfth century, and thus he proceeds.",5Books,History,"‘“Why, dear Jane,” he said, “do you scatter good grain on the ground; would it not be better to make good bread of it than to throw it to the greedy chickens?”",,"‘“Why, dear Jane,” he said, “do you scatter good grain on the ground; would it not be better to make good bread of it than to throw it to the greedy chickens?”",4Books,History,"And yet, if one sets about constituting an ideal genius, what a great deal of the Celt does one find oneself drawn to put into it!  Of an ideal genius one does not want the elements, any of them, to be in a state of weakness; on the contrary, one wants all of them to be in the highest state of power; but with a law of measure, of harmony, presiding over the whole.  So the sensibility of the Celt, if everything else were not sacrificed to it, is a beautiful and admirable force.  For sensibility, the power of quick and strong perception and emotion, is one of the very prime constituents of genius, perhaps its most positive constituent; it is to the soul what good senses are to the body, the grand natural condition of successful activity.  Sensibility gives genius its materials; one cannot have too much of it, if one can but keep its master and not be its slave.  Do not let us wish that the Celt had had less sensibility, but that he had been more master of it.  Even as it is, if his sensibility has been a source of weakness to him, it has been a source of power too, and a source of happiness.  Some people have found in the Celtic nature and its sensibility the main root out of which chivalry and romance and the glorification of a feminine ideal spring; this is a great question, with which I cannot deal here.  Let me notice in passing, however, that there is, in truth, a Celtic air about the extravagance of chivalry, its reaction against the despotism of fact, its straining human nature further than it will stand.  But putting all this question of chivalry and its origin on one side, no doubt the sensibility of the Celtic nature, its nervous exaltation, have something feminine in them, and the Celt is thus peculiarly disposed to feel the spell of the feminine idiosyncrasy; he has an affinity to it; he is not far from its secret.  Again, his sensibility gives him a peculiarly near and intimate feeling of nature and the life of nature; here, too, he seems in a special way attracted by the secret before him, the secret of natural beauty and natural magic, and to be close to it, to half-divine it.  In the productions of the Celtic genius, nothing, perhaps, is so interesting as the evidences of this power: I shall have occasion to give specimens of them by-and-by.  The same sensibility made the Celts full of reverence and enthusiasm for genius, learning, and the things of the mind; _to be a bard_, _freed a man_,—that is a characteristic stroke of this generous and ennobling ardour of theirs, which no race has ever shown more strongly.  Even the extravagance and exaggeration of the sentimental Celtic nature has often something romantic and attractive about it, something which has a sort of smack of misdirected good.  The Celt, undisciplinable, anarchical, and turbulent by nature, but out of affection and admiration giving himself body and soul to some leader, that is not a promising political temperament, it is just the opposite of the Anglo-Saxon temperament, disciplinable and steadily obedient within certain limits, but retaining an inalienable part of freedom and self-dependence; but it is a temperament for which one has a kind of sympathy notwithstanding.  And very often, for the gay defiant reaction against fact of the lively Celtic nature one has more than sympathy; one feels, in spite of the extravagance, in spite of good sense disapproving, magnetised and exhilarated by it.  The Gauls had a rule inflicting a fine on every warrior who, when he appeared on parade, was found to stick out too much in front,—to be corpulent, in short.  Such a rule is surely the maddest article of war ever framed, and to people to whom nature has assigned a large volume of intestines, must appear, no doubt, horrible; but yet has it not an audacious, sparkling, immaterial manner with it, which lifts one out of routine, and sets one’s spirits in a glow?","And yet, if one sets about constituting an ideal genius, what a great deal of the Celt does one find oneself drawn to put into it!

Other than it's location close to Pisa's main Station, there was little to recommend it. Yes, the reception area has the wow factor. It looks clean, modern and welcoming. However this doesn't extend to the staff, who were unfriendly to say the least and didn't acknowledge the fact we were newly weds despite it saying so on our booking form, Sadly the reception area was the only 'wow' that the hotel had. We were on the first floor and once again at first glance it appeared very nice. Looking closer however and you notice the dirty carpets and the wrinkled sticky back plastic covered doors. Inside the room, the carpet was stained, there were marks all up the wall and it had only two plug sockets with which to charge your ipad, camera or phone, and to use these you had to unplug the bedside light. The bed didn't have proper bedding. There was a sheet, a duvet without a cover and another sheet covering that.  Breakfast was ok but the hotels location to the Field of Miracles was quite a long walk (about 25 minutes) and not suitable if you are infirm or just hate walking.

Sure, it has lots of shoot-em-up action, but a very thin thread of a story about foreign thugs holding captive a big business celebration party at the top of a high-rise in L.A. to try and steal the $450 million of certificates in the safe. It is predominantly Willis as the N.Y. cop, coming to visit his L.A. businesswoman wife, and his outsmarting the bad guys. It even ends in a neat little package with him and his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) walking out arm-in-arm.

This is another time travel picture but instead of time travel it's called 'inversion' which is really time travel by the back door so that about midway through the forward thrust of the plot takes a back seat and we start going back in time or maybe 'back to the future'; at least I think that was what was happening. To be honest, by now I didn't really care. I had long stopped trying to 'follow' the movie and was now just sitting back and enjoying every daft minute of it.Of course, it's not the first time Nolan has mucked about with 'inversion' or just played havoc with our perceptions of reality. ""Momento"" told its story backwards while I'm still puzzling over ""Inception"". This, you may argue, is cleverness for its own sake but I'm sure Nolan doesn't expect anyone to take a calculus or a set of algorithms into the cinema. He knows this is nonsense and he's just messing with us and messing with us on a supersonic level. First and last ""Tenet"", (oh, and the title's a palindrome, geddit?), is just a big, dumb-but-prentending-to-be-clever action flic with some of the most terrific set-pieces in years, (an 'inverted' car chase sets a new high). It's also got a deliberately cheesy script and some bravura tonge-in-cheek performances.If John David Washington is a little too insouciant as the hero, (or the protagonist as he keeps referring to himself), he's ably backed up by a superb Robert Pattinson as his sidekick, a terrific Kenneth Branagh relishing his role as the villain to end all villains, (please cast him in the next Bond movie), and a spunky Elizabeth Debicki as a time-travelling wife, mother and potential love interest. You don't expect performances of this quality in nonsense of this kind so let's just say they are a bonus. The final bonkers, saving the world from total destruction climax is over-extended and the movie tidies itself up a little too smugly but I'll forgive these minor blemishes when everything else is so much fun.","There's been a great deal of talk about the impenetrability of the plot of Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster ""Tenet"" when, in fact, the plot isn't so much inpenetrable, (the 'plot' itself, for want of a better word, is actually quite simple and is spelled out in the first fifteen minutes or so), as sci-fi silly.

They try to help their ex-general (Dean Jagger) from loosing his Vermont inn. The love interest is provided by Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney.I've seen this multiple times (once in a brand new print at a repertory theatre)--and I've never really liked it. It starts off great with Crosby singing the title song to soldiers during WWII--that scene really works and is quietly powerful--but then the film falls to pieces. The script is--to be nice--pretty terrible with a totally predictable plot and tired comedy. None of the actors are given roles to play. Kaye seems lost and Clooney and Ellen try to inject life into their characters. Jagger is also far too mild-mannered to play a tough Army general. Only Crosby with his easy-going charm and Mary Wickes (with the few funny lines) really pull off any acting. The songs are pretty unmemorable--""What Can You Do With a General"" has got to be one of the all time worst songs I've heard in a movie. All the sets look impressive--but they're very obviously sets--especially the outdoor ones. And there's no snow or anything Christmas-like until the last 5 minutes! This film does have its good points. It was the first film shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process) and the movie takes full advantage of it with a few elaborate production numbers in bright beautiful Technicolor. Also Kaye and Crosby do have a funny number in drag (sort of) and the beautiful, bright color and some interesting costumes keep you mildly interested. All the singing is good and some of the dancing is just incredible (especially with Ellen).But all in all this is too long (a half hour could have been chopped off), too slow and too badly written for me to like it. Give me ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""Holiday Inn"" over this.

There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate.

We ﬁnd that the Sherman counties produced more agricultural output and included farms that were relatively more valuable, though again these diﬀerences fade with state ﬁxed eﬀects. At the same time, consistent with the historical evidence, we do not ﬁnd any diﬀerence in terms of manufacturing activity, which overall was low across this whole region. Overall, while Sherman counties do not appear to be identical to non-Sherman counties, these results show that accounting for across- state variation, the diﬀerences in observable characteristics are relatively modest. In Section 4, we discuss how our research design accounts for underlying diﬀerences in the march and non-march counties, including the use of ﬂexible controls and with a diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences strategy, as well as instrumenting for Sherman’s ﬁnal path",,"Demographically, the counties Sherman hit were more populous, but not denser or more urban, and even the raw population diﬀerences fade when we include state ﬁxed eﬀects (column 4).",4Research and Innovation,Economics,"Postwar underdevelopment in credit markets played an important role in explaining the extent of the relative eﬀects and the delay in recovery. Credit from the banking sector completely dried up after the Civil War: we document that nearly every bank and branch in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina shut down right after the war. This lack of credit may have interfered with the recovery process, particularly in counties hit by Sherman. We provide three main pieces of evidence in favor of this hypothesis, using demographic data, information on local infrastructure (such as railroads), and newly digitized data on local bank and Southern credit-market conditions. First, we show that potential alternative mechanisms—a demographic shift or the lack of infrastructure—do not explain the large eﬀects of the march, even in the decade after the Civil War. Contrary to some common beliefs about the eﬀects of Sherman’s destruction, we ﬁnd that the march did not signiﬁ- cantly aﬀect the demographic patterns in aﬀected counties. Neither whites nor African Americans ﬂed march counties at faster rates than they left non-march counties. In addition, infrastructure access and investment, as measured by the number of county railroad miles in each decade from 1850–1920, was not diﬀerential across march and non-march counties.5 Second, we ﬁnd that the lack of provision of credit made the immediate recovery more diﬃcult in the manufacturing sector. In particular, counties that were more dependent on credit before the war experienced slower postwar manufacturing recovery following the march. Since formal credit markets were deeply impaired by the war, we measure dependence by looking at those counties where companies could have more easily accessed ﬁnancing in the prewar period. Speciﬁcally, we look at counties located closer to a bank branch or where lending markets were particularly active, proxied with the number of ﬁrms tracked in the county by Dun, Boyd, & Company, a credit-ratings agency (Brennecke 2016; González, Marshall, and Naidu 2017). For these counties, we ﬁnd much 4Our baseline speciﬁcation already controls for county ﬁxed eﬀects—which control ﬂexibly for time-invariant county characteristics—and state-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects, absorbing any time-varying shocks common to all counties within a state. We also augment this speciﬁcation with a series of pre-shock controls interacted with time dummies, which condition our parameters to heterogeneity in observables across treatment in the prewar period",,Postwar underdevelopment in credit markets played an important role in explaining the extent of the relative eﬀects and the delay in recovery.,4Research and Innovation,Economics,The growth rates are winsorized at 1% to reduce the impact of outliers in our analysis,,The growth rates are winsorized at 1% to reduce the impact of outliers in our analysis,5Research and Innovation,Economics,"The same holds for agricultural investments, but in this case the eﬀect is weaker statistically",,"The same holds for agricultural investments, but in this case the eﬀect is weaker statistically",2Research and Innovation,Economics,"The results are similar with the full sample, as the results by decade in Table A.5 suggest",,"The results are similar with the full sample, as the results by decade in Table A.5 suggest",3Research and Innovation,Law,"Our discussion in the following paper steps back and reflects on the role of the ILC Articles in the wider field of international law.3 Three comments by James Crawford, which in our view capture three essential features of the ILC Articles, structure the discussion.
